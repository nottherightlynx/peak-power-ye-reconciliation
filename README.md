**Peak Power Services – Year-End Reconciliation and Risk Dashboard (FY 2025)**

_This repository contains a self-service year-end reconciliation pipeline and dashboard, designed from the perspective of an Accounting Associate with data engineering skills. It simulates Peak Power Services’ 2025 year-end close for a project-based power/telecom services company operating in Florida, and demonstrates how AP, cash, sales & use tax, and ASC 842 lease work can be made more automated, consistent, and review-ready._

The project consists of three core components:
1) Synthetic but realistic data for a 2025 year-end scenario
2) A rule-based validator and risk-scoring pipeline aligned to GAAP and internal controls
3) A Streamlit dashboard for controllers, billing, and leadership to self-serve close status and exceptions

_validator.py reads from data/ (or BigQuery tables), applies checks and scoring via scoring_rules.py, and writes enriched CSVs to output/.

dashboard.py is presentation-only; it reads the output/*.csv files and surfaces the risk profile, exceptions, and suggested journal entries._

2. Business Context and Goals

Peak Power Services is a Florida-based services company with:
- High-volume accounts payable
- Multiple vendors and projects
- Sales and use tax exposure across Florida jurisdictions
- Several operating leases under ASC 842

The project simulates the Accounting Associate’s role in year-end close:
- Tie subledgers (AP, leases) and bank activity to the GL
- Validate sales and use tax calculations and liability balances
- Highlight high-risk discrepancies instead of scanning every line manually
- Provide controller-ready journal entry suggestions and summarized risk views

**The intent is to demonstrate how a mid-sized accounting function can combine GAAP, tax, and lease expertise with light data engineering to “work smarter, not harder” at year-end.**

3. Running the Project Locally

From the project root:

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows


Install requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If starting from base data, run the validator:

python validator.py


This writes AP_with_risk.csv, Bank_with_risk.csv, Tax_with_risk.csv, and Lease_with_risk.csv to output/.

Run the dashboard:

python -m streamlit run dashboard.py


Then open the URL printed in your terminal (typically http://localhost:8501).

4. How Controllers and Billing Supervisors Use This

Controller
- Reviews high-risk items first
- Validates whether proposed JEs are appropriate
- Uses risk distributions and counts to judge overall close readiness

Billing Supervisor
- Investigates specific vendors or invoices identified as high risk
- Coordinates corrections in AP and billing processes

Senior Leadership
- Sees a single, unified view of where risk and volume are concentrated
- Gains confidence that year-end close is systematic, not purely manual

5. Future Enhancements

This framework can be extended to:
- Run on a schedule with a warehouse (BigQuery) backend
- Integrate with QuickBooks, NetSuite, or other ERPs
- Add natural language querying for non-technical users
- Incorporate ML-based anomaly detection on top of the rule-based layer
- Support multi-entity, multi-jurisdiction close in a consolidated environment

6. Intended Use

This repository is a demonstration project. Data is synthetic but realistic. Before using similar code in production:
- Align thresholds and weights with your materiality and control structure
- Review tax logic with tax specialists
- Review lease logic with technical accounting resources
- Confirm that suggested JEs follow your organization’s chart of accounts and policy

It is designed to show how an Accounting Associate can bridge detailed reconciliations, internal controls, and lightweight data engineering to create a “close command center” for year-end work.
